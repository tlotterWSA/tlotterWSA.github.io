LEDs rapidly blinking in sequence means the charger is ready to charge. Of the three LEDs blinking green three times means that charging is initiated. One LED slowly blinking green means charging is in progress with state of charge <33%. 1 solid green LED and 2nd LED slowly blinking means charging is in progress with state of charge 34%-66%. 2 solid green LEDs and 3rd LED slowly blinking means charging is in progress and state of charge is 67%-99%. 3 solid green LEDs mean that hearing instrument is fully charged. LEDs blinking rapidly orange in sequence means the charger is cooling down. All LEDs blinking red means an error has occured.
